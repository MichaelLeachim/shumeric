Assume:
* no timezone problem
* no restrictions on data amount

* Create barebones view (so we don't have to look at "shumeric" in miktau implementation)
* Implement (working base):
  * create session
  * see it running (ticker? / setTimeout?)
  * see last 10 days breakdown
  * last year contributions widget
  
* Then:
  * Make contribution counters
  * Tag autocomplete
  * Download results as spreadsheet
  * Save data into firebase
  * Have a "share link" that works across machines
  * Have a "new link" that will create a new workspace
  * Notify when session closed
